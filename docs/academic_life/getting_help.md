This page lists resources for Augusta University students to receive
help with their course of studies, [in general](#general), for [students
of the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences](#school), and for [this
course in particular](#course).

# In General

Many resources are available to help you be a successful student:

- If you are food insecure, [you are not
  alone](https://www.wjbf.com/csra-news/nearly-36-percent-of-college-students-are-hungry/),
  and the [Open Paws Food
  Pantry](https://www.augusta.edu/student-affairs/open-paws.php) will
  help you.
- For tutoring resources, consult the [Academic Success
  Center](https://www.augusta.edu/academicsuccess/) (or “ASC”). It can
  help you, among other things, in the areas of time management, test
  preparation and study strategies.
- [Student Counseling & Psychological
  Services](https://www.augusta.edu/counseling/) (or “SCAPS”) is here to
  assist students with a variety of personal, developmental, and mental
  health concerns.
- The [Writing Center](https://www.augusta.edu/pamplin/writingcenter/)
  can help you with any written, oral, or multimedia project.
- To get help with technologies, refer to our [Instructional Technology
  Support](https://www.augusta.edu/continuity/index.php) correspondent
  [Sienna Sewell](https://spots.augusta.edu/sSewell/).
- The [Department of Multicultural Student Engagement
  (MSE)](https://www.augusta.edu/multicultural/) aims to provide
  education, training, and programming to foster awareness of diversity
  and inclusion among Augusta University students. Their [Multicultural
  Mentorship Program and African American Male
  Initiative](https://www.augusta.edu/multicultural/programming.php) are
  excellent resources to receive additional help.

# For Students of the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences

## School of Computer and Cyber Sciences Tutoring Center

The School has a tutoring center that can be reached:

- On [discord](https://discord.gg/AYSw3UNKEh),
- During their tutoring hours (hours posted on the door and on discord),
  in [University Hall](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=824#!m/268018) 129.

## ACM Club

The [Augusta University chapter](https://spots.augusta.edu/cyberdefense)
of the
[A.C.M](https://www.acm.org/ "Association for Computing Machinery") is
one of the university’s best resources for Computer Science, Information
Technology and Cyber Security students. It provides a platform to
network with other students in similar majors, presenting countless
opportunities to not only expand the people you know, but also a
fantastic place to learn and ask questions. To learn more, you can sign
up for the newsletter, or attend one of the subgroup meetings (meeting
times and locations are listed [on the
website](https://spots.augusta.edu/cyberdefense)).

## Other Club Activities

The Augusta University Game Design Club and Girls Who Code College Loop
“will be continuing activities in full force this year”. Notifications
for upcoming activities will be shared in class alongside school-wide
emails.

# For This Course

## Instructors

You have three instructors this semester:

- Dr. DeFrancisco (Section A–D),
- Dr. Aubert (Section E and F),
- Jason Weeks (Labs).

Please, refer to your syllabus for their office hours or how to reach
them.

## Graduate Course Assistant

Jason Weeks:  
- <jaweeks@augusta.edu>
- Instructor for CSCI 1301 Labs
- The best way to contact me is via email or through
  [Discord](http://discordapp.com/users/269850129022976000). I’m fairly
  active on both, so I should get back to you pretty quickly there. I
  almost never check Teams and it doesn’t send me notifications, so I
  will likely miss any messages there.
- I’m a first year Master’s student, holding a Bachelor’s in CS and a
  minor in Math, and I’ve been working as a course assistant for over
  three years. I can’t wait to help out another semester of 1301
  students learn to code!

## Commenting Using a Github Account

On this website, if [you look below](#how-is-this-page), you will see a
box where you can comment. This will require that you create a [Github
account](https://github.com/login), which is free and may serve multiple
purpose if you intend to study, use, or contribute to open-source
projects. The comment can use the [markdown
syntax](https://commonmark.org/) (exactly like this resource!), which is
also used on websites like
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help) and extremely
popular!

## How to Ask a Question?

It may seems silly, but asking a question “the right way” may not always
be easy.

1.  Once you’ve identified your issue, try again from scratch to see if
    you missed a point.
2.  Go over the instructions, and [look in our
    resources](https://github.com/csci-1301/csci-1301.github.io/search?q=ask+a+question)
    for some meaningful keywords.
3.  Think about how you can describe your issue, what is the shortest
    route to reproduce it.
4.  If you are still facing difficulties, be detailed and clear about
    what you think went wrong: if the question is related to computers,
    specify which operating system, what you have tried, the exact
    nature of the error message, etc. Screenshots are not always the
    right way to convey your question: try to be descriptive, and
    explain what you tried. If you want to refer to a particular lab or
    lecture, open the corresponding page, look for the closest title,
    hover over it, and you should see a “§” symbol appears: click on it,
    you can now [share that
    link](https://www.wikihow.com/Copy-and-Paste-a-Link) so that your
    interlocutor knows precisely what you are talking about!

And, remember: your instructor(s) knows that you are a student and here
to learn, so you should *never* feel intimidated or assume that
*everyone knows better than you*: many students struggle in this class
at times, and you could actually do them all a favor by asking your
instructor(s) to go over a particular dimension that they may have
overlooked or explained poorly!
