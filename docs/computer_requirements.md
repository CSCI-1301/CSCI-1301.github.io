# In Short

Bottom line: 
~ 
    Anything less than 5 years old is probably fine, [some operating systems](#in-terms-of-operating-system) can prove more challenging than others.
    Second hand is fine.

Expanded:
~ 
    It does not matter if your computer is powerful enough to run [virtual machines](#virtual-machines), that is, has

    - at least 4 cores, 2.66 GHz CPU,
    - at least 8GB of ram,
    - at least ~50 GB of hard drive.
    
    Otherwise, or if you do not wish to run [virtual machines](#virtual-machines), then avoiding Apple products and running Windows is probably a safer bet.
    If you know how to factory-reset a computer and / or how to (re)install an operating system, then buying second-hand is perfectly fine.

As an example:

~ 
    [Dr. Aubert](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/) uses a [Dell Latitude 5480/5488](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/latitude-14-5480-laptop/docs) from **2017** (_but in no way endorses it_) with 

    - 4 cores, 2.40 GHz CPU,
    - 8GB of ram,
    - 238 GB of hard drive,
    - Windows 10,
    
    and of courses wishes that it was a bit more responsive at times, but can conduct otherwise all his professional activities.

# In Terms of Operating System

We will briefly consider four "families" of operating systems:

- [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) (Windows 10, Windows 11, etc.)
- [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) (macOS Ventura, macOS Sonoma, etc.)
- [Linux operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) (Ubuntu, Debian, Gentoo, etc.)
- Operating systems that uses their web browsers as their principal user interface (essentially, [ChromeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS)).

In short: 
~ 
    Anything but ChromeOS is (probably) fine. 
    
Expanded:
~ 
    - If you are (planning on) using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) as your IDE, then windows is probably your best choice of operating system.
    - If you need to use macOS for whatever reason, then you will probably be able to accommodate all the requirements, but it may require some tweaking at times.
    - Using Linux-based operating systems are a great way to learn how to tinker with your computer (you have full control!), but will sometimes require you to be creative to meet courses expectations.
    - [Virtual machines](#virtual-machines) allow you to simulate (almost) any operating system using (almost) any operating system, and is required for some courses. Using virtual machines means, essentially, that your choice of operating system _does not matter at all_.
    - Remember that [multi-boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting) (that is, installing multiple operating systems side-by-side) is an option.

## Virtual Machines

You can find [on this page](software_install.html#installing-anything-anywhere) some indications on how to run a virtual machine on your computer.

**Note that CSCI 4532 - Hardware and Embedded Systems and CSCI 4531 - Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering _require_ you to run virtual machines. If you are planning on taking one of those classes, make sure your computer can run virtual machines!**

# Where to Buy?

That is really up to you, but remember that, as a student (or employee), you are allowed to 

- [Some discounts](https://my.augusta.edu/discounts/electronics.php),
- [A free licence for Windows](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=696fbf50-4829-476c-bfc8-09974888f850#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/~/software),

Second-hand computers or even custom-built computers are probably fine, but requires more skills and inspections on your end.
