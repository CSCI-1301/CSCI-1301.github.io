# C# Fundamentals

## Introduction to the C# Language

- C# is a managed language (as introduced in previous lecture)
    - Write in a high-level language, compile to intermediate language, run intermediate language in interpreter
    - Intermediate language is called CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
    - Interpreter is called .NET Runtime
    - Standard library is called .NET Framework, comes with the compiler and runtime
- It is widespread and popular
    - It was the first in the list of ["3 Future Programming Languages You Should Learn Between 2022 and 2030"](https://betterprogramming.pub/3-future-programming-languages-you-should-learn-between-2022-and-2030-8a618a15eca6), because of the growing popularity of [Unity](https://unity.com/).
    - [8th most "loved" language on StackOverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved)
    - .NET is the [2nd most used "other" library/framework](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-other-frameworks-libraries-and-tools)

## The Object-Oriented Paradigm

- C# is called an "object-oriented" language
    - Programming languages have different *paradigms*: philosophies for organizing code, expressing ideas
    - Object-oriented is one such paradigm, C# uses it
    - Meaning of object-oriented: Program mostly consists of *objects*, which are reusable modules of code
    - Each object contains some data (*attributes*) and some functions related to that data (*methods*)
- Object-oriented terms
    - **Class**: A blueprint or template for an object. Code that defines what kind of data the object will contain and what operations (functions) you will be able to do with that data
    - **Object**: A single instance of a class, containing running code with specific values for the data. Each object is a separate "copy" based on the template given by the class.\
    Analogy: A *class* is like a floorplan while an  *object* is the house build from the floorplan. Plus, you can make as many houses as you would like from a single floorplan.
    - **Attribute**: A piece of data stored in an object.\
    Example: A *House* class has a spot for a color property while an house object has a color (e.g. "Green").
    - **Method**: A function that modifies an object. This code is part of the class, but when it runs, it modifies only a specific object and not the class.\
    Example: A *House* class with a method to change the house color. Using this method changes the color a single house object but doesn't change the *House* class or the color on any other house objects.

- Examples:
    - A Car *Class*
        - Attributes: Color, engine status (on/off), gear position
        - Methods: Press gas or brake pedal, turn key on/off, shift transmission
    - A Car *Object*\
      Example: A *Porsche911* object that is Red, Engine On, and in 1st gear
    - An "Audio File" *Class* represents a song being played in a music player
        - Attributes: Sound wave data, current playback position, target speaker device
        - Methods: Play, pause, stop, fast-forward, rewind
    - An Audio File *Object*\
      Example: A *NeverGonnaGiveYouUp* object that is "rolled wave data", 0:00, speaker01

## First Program

Here's a simple "hello world" program in the C# language:


#### Hello World

<!-- TODO: title this code block -->

```
!include code/hello_world.cs
```

Features of this program:

- A multi-line comment: everything between the `/*` and `*/` is considered a *comment*, i.e. text for humans to read. It will be ignored by the C# compiler and has no effect on the program.
- A `using` statement: This imports code definitions from the System *namespace*, which is part of the .NET Framework (the standard library).
    - In C#, code is organized into **namespaces**, which group related classes together
    - If you want to use code from a different namespace, you need a `using` statement to "import" that namespace
    - All the standard library code is in different namespaces from the code you will be writing, so you'll need `using` statements to access it
- A class declaration
    - Syntax:
      <pre>
      class [name of class]
      {
           body of the class
      }
      </pre>
    - All code between opening `{` and closing `}` is part of the class named by the `class [name]` statement
- A method declaration
    - A collection of instructions with a name
    - Can be used by typing its name
    - A method is similar to a paragraph, in that it can contain multiple statements, and a class is similar to a chapter, in that it can have multiple methods within its body.
    - A C# program requires a method called `Main`, and, in our example, is followed by empty parentheses (we'll get to those later, but they're required)
    - Just like the class declaration, the body of the method beings with `{` and ends with `}`
- A statement inside the body of the method: `Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!"); // I'm an in-line comment.`
    - This is the part of the program that actually "does something": It prints a line of text to the console
    - This statement contains a class name (`Console`), followed by a method name (`WriteLine`). It calls the `WriteLine` method in the `Console` class.
    - The **argument** to the `WriteLine` method is the text "Hello, world!", which is in parentheses after the name of the method. This is the text that gets printed in the console: The `WriteLine` method (which is in the standard library) takes an argument and prints it to the console.
    - Note that the argument to `WriteLine` is inside double-quotes. This means it is a **string**, i.e. textual data, not a piece of C# code. The quotes are required in order to distinguish between text and code.
    - A statement *must* end in a semicolon (the class header and method header aren't statements)
- An in-line comment: All the text from the `//` to the end of the line is considered a comment, and is ignored by the C# compiler.

## Rules of C# Syntax

- Each statement must end in a semicolon (`;`), except for some statements that we will study in the future that contains opening `{` and closing `}`, that do not end in a `;`. 
    - Note that class and method declarations, as well as comments, [are not statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/statements) and hence do not need to ends with a `;`. Typically, a method *contains* some statements, but it is not a statement.
- All words are case-sensitive
    - A class named `Program` is not the same as one named `program`
    - A method named `writeline` is not the same as one named `WriteLine`
- Braces and parentheses must always be matched
    - Once you start a class or method definition with `{`, you must end it with `}`
- Whitespace -- spaces, tabs, and newlines -- has almost no meaning
    - There must be at least 1 space between words
    - Spaces are counted exactly if they are inside string data, e.g. `"Hello      world!"`
    - Otherwise, entire program could be written on one line; it would have the same meaning
    - Spaces and new lines are just to help humans read the code
- All C# applications must have a `Main` method
    - Name must match exactly, otherwise .NET runtime will get confused
    - This is the first code to run when the application starts -- any other code (in methods) will only run when its method is called

## Conventions of C# Programs

- Conventions: Not enforced by the compiler/language, but expected by humans
    - Program will still work if you break them, but other programmers will be confused
- Indentation
    - After a class or method declaration (header), put the opening `{` on a new line underneath it
    - Then indent the next line by 4 spaces, and all other lines "inside" the class or method body
    - De-indent by 4 spaces at end of method body, so ending `}` aligns vertically with opening `{`
    - Method definition inside class definition: Indent body of method by another 4 spaces
    - In general, any code between `{` and `}` should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the `{` and `}`
- Code files
    - C# code is stored in files that end with the extension ".cs"
    - Each ".cs" file contains exactly one class
    - The name of the file is the same as the name of the class (Program.cs contains `class Program`)

## Reserved Words and Identifiers

- Reserved words: Keywords in the C# language
    - Note they have a distinct color in the code sample and in Visual Studio
    - Built-in commands/features of the language
    - Can only be used for one specific purpose; meaning cannot be changed
    - Examples:
        - `using`
        - `class`
        - `public`
        - `private`
        - `namespace`
        - `this`
        - `if`
        - `else`
        - `for`
        - `while`
        - `do`
        - `return`
- Identifiers: Human-chosen names
    - Names for classes (`Rectangle`, `ClassRoom`, etc.), variables (`age`, `name`, etc.), methods (`ComputeArea`, `GetLength`, etc), namespaces, etc.
    - Some have already been chosen for the standard library (e.g. `Console`, `WriteLine`), but they are still identifiers, not keywords
    - Rules for identifiers:
        - Must not be a reserved word
        - Must contain only letters (`a` → `Z`), numbers (`0` → `9`), and underscore (`_`)-- no spaces
        - Must not begin with a number
        - Are case sensitive
        - Must be unique (you cannot re-use the same identifier twice in the same scope -- a concept we will discuss later)
    - Conventions for identifiers
        - Should be descriptive, e.g. "`AudioFile`" or "`userInput`" not "`a`" or "`x`"
        - Should be easy for humans to read and type
        - If name is multiple words, use [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) (or its variation [Pascal case](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/8a67c0/C-Sharp-coding-standards-and-naming-conventions/)) to distinguish words
        - Class and method names should start with capitals, e.g. "`class AudioFile`"
        - Variable names should start with lowercase letters, then capitalize subsequent words, e.g. "`myFavoriteNumber`"

## Write and WriteLine

- The `WriteLine` method

    - We saw this in the "Hello World" program: `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` results in "Hello World!" being displayed in the terminal

    - In general, `Console.WriteLine("text");` will display the text but not the "'s in the terminal, then *start a new line*

    - This means a second `Console.WriteLine` will display its text on the next line of the terminal. For example, this program:

        ```
        !include code/writeline_two_lines.cs
        ```

      will display the following output in the terminal:

        ```text
        Hello
        World!
        ```

- Methods with multiple statements
    - Note that our two-line example has a `Main` method with multiple statements
    - In C#, each statement must end in a semicolon
    - Class and method declarations are not statements
    - Each line of code in your .cs file is not necessarily a statement
    - A single invocation/call of the `WriteLine` method is a statement
- The `Write` method

    - `Console.WriteLine("text")` prints the text, then starts a new line in the terminal -- it effectively "hits enter" after printing the text

    - `Console.Write("text")` just prints the text, without starting a new line. It's like typing the text without hitting "enter" afterwards.

    - Even though two `Console.Write` calls are two statements, and appear on two lines, they will result in the text being printed on just one line. For example, this program:

        ```
        !include code/write_two_lines.cs
        ```

      will display the following output in the terminal:

        ```text
        HelloWorld!
        ```

    - Note that there is no space between "Hello" and "World!" because we didn't type one in the argument to `Console.Write`
- Combining `Write` and `WriteLine`

    - We can use both `WriteLine` and `Write` in the same program

    - After a call to `Write`, the "cursor" is on the same line after the printed text; after a call to `WriteLine` the "cursor" is at the beginning of the next line

    - This program:

        ```
        !include code/write_and_writeline.cs
        ```

      will display the following output in the terminal:

        ```text
        Hello world!
        Welcome to CSCI 1301!
        ```

## Escape Sequences

- Explicitly writing a new line

    - So far we've used `WriteLine` when we want to create a new line in the output

    - The **escape sequence** `\n` can also be used to create a new line -- it represents the "newline character," which is what gets printed when you type "enter"

    - This program will produce the same output as our two-line "Hello World" example, with each word on its own line:

        ```
        !include code/write_with_newline.cs
        ```

- Escape sequences in detail
    - An **escape sequence** uses "normal" letters to represent "special", hard-to-type characters
    - `\n` represents the newline character, i.e. the result of pressing "enter"
    - `\t` represents the tab character, which is a single extra-wide space (you usually get it by pressing the "tab" key)
    - `\"` represents a double-quote character that will get printed on the screen, rather than ending the text string in the C# code.

        - Without this, you couldn't write a sentence with quotation marks in a `Console.WriteLine`, because the C# compiler would assume the quotation marks meant the string was ending

        - This program won't compile because `in quotes` is not valid C# code, and the compiler thinks it is not part of the string:

            ```
            class Welcome
            {
                static void Main()
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("This is "in quotes"");
                }
            }
            ```

        - This program will display the sentence including the quotation marks:

            ```
            !include code/escape_quotes.cs
            ```

    - Note that all escape sequences begin with a backslash character (`\`)
    - General format is `\[key letter]` -- the letter after the backslash is like a "keyword" indicating which special character to display
    - If you want to put an actual backslash in your string, you need the escape sequence `\\`, which prints a single backslash
        - This will result in a compile error because `\U` is not a valid escape sequence:

            ```
            Console.WriteLine("Go to C:\Users\Edward");
            ```

        - This will display the path correctly:

            ```
            Console.WriteLine("Go to C:\\Users\\Edward");
            ```
