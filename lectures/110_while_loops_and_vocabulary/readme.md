# `--` and `++` Operators

In programming, there are many cases that we either need to increment or decrement the value of one variable by one unit. C# provides special optimized operators for this purpose.

- The `++` operator takes an operand and adds one to the value of the operand. Hence, the operand must be a variable.
- `x++;` or `++x;` are similar to  `x = x + 1;`
- Similarly, the `--` operator takes an operand and decrements the value of the operand by one. Hence, the operand must be a variable.
- `x--;` or `--x;` are similar to  `x = x - 1;`
- Both of the `--` and `++` operators can be written before or after an operand.
- If they are put before the operand, they act on the operand, and then the result will be returned. See the bellow example:
```
int x = 10;
int y = x++;  \\ First y = 10; then x = x + 1
```
- If they are put after the operand, the current value of the operand will be returned, and then the current value of the operand will be changed. See the bellow example:
```
int x = 10;
int y = ++x;  \\ First x = x + 1, so x = 11; then y = x, So y = 11
```


# Loops

One of the significant reasons humans use computers is to execute a specific process without mistakes repeatedly. Therefore, each programming language provides some statements that iterate a block of code. In this course, you will learn `while`, `do-while`, `for`, and `foreach` statements that are used for implementing loops. 

## `while` Statement

The `while` statement executes a block of statements while a specified _boolean expression_ evaluates to true at the beginning of each iteration. 
- Essentially, the boolean expression should evaluate to true as many times as you want the block of statements to loop, and the boolean expression should evaluate to false when you want the looping to end.

### Formal Syntax

```
while (<boolean expression>)
    <code block> or <a statement>
```

- In the above code, `<code block>` or `<a statement>` is called the loop body.
<!-- This notion should have been introduced earlier, and I believe it has been. -->
<!-- Since this is the first time that we introduce loops, I assume we have not introduced the loop body. But, if we have, remove the code -->

### Example 1
The underneath example prints numbers 1 to 5 in the console. Note that the loop bode is a code block consist of two statements.
```
int number = 1;
while (number <=5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    number++;
}
```
- Remember, one or more statements enclosed in left and right braces is called a code block.


### Example 2
The underneath example does the same as Example 1, but its body loop consists of only one statement. Hence, there is no need for braces).

```
int number = 1;
while (number <=5)
    Console.WriteLine(number++);
```



### Example 3

```
int number = 1;
while (true)
    Console.WriteLine(number++);
```

- Note, if `<boolean expression>` is always true, then the program loops until the program fails or an special statement(See the next section) in the loop body ends the loop!
- A program may fail for sevral reasons like
    - Power outage
    - Hardware malfunctinong
    - Operating System issue.
    
## `break` statement
The `break` statement ends a loop immediately. 

### Example
```
int number = 1;
while (true)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    number++;
    if(number > 5) break;
}
```

## `continue` statement

This command ends the current iteration of a loop and skips the remaming statements in the body of the loop.

### Example
```
int number = 0;
while (number <= 100)
{
    number++;
    if(number % 2 == 1) continue;
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```
- The above code prints all the even numbers from 1 to 100.

### Six Ways a `while` Loop Can Go Wrong

It is easy to write _wrong_ `loop` statements. 
Let us review some of the "classic" blunders.

#### 1- Failing to update the variable occurring in the condition


```
int number = 0;
while (number <=5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

Number isn't changed!

#### 2- Updating the "wrong" value

```
int number1, number = 0;
while (number <=5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    number1++;
}
```

#### 3- Having an empty body

```
int number = 0; 
while (number <=5); // Note the semi-colon here!
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    number++;
}
```

#### 4- Missing braces

```
int number = 0;
while (number <=5)
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    number++;
```

#### 5- Going in the wrong direction

```
int number = 5;
while (number >=0)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    number++;
}
```

The variable `number` should be decremented, not incremented.

#### 6- Multiplying by zero

```
int number = 0;
while (number <=64)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    number *= 2;
}
```

The variable `number` will always result in zero, causing the condition to never be fulfilled, so the loop will go on infinitely. (The intended behavior here was to get `0 2 4 8 16 ...` but they got `0 0 0 ...` instead.)

## `do-while` Statement
As like as the `while` statement, the `do-while` statement executes a block or a statement while a specified _boolean expression_ evaluates to true. But, the boolean expression is evaluated at the end of each iteration. Consequently, the loop body of a `do-while` loop executes at least once.

### Formal Syntax

```
do
    <code block> or <a statement>
while (<boolean expression>);
```

### Example
```
int number = 1;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    number++;
}while (number <=5);
```

## User-Input Validation

We can use loops to test what was entered by the user, and ask again if the value does not fit our needs:

### Example 1
```
Console.WriteLine("Please enter a positive number");
int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
while (n < 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"You entered <{n}>, I asked you for a positive number. Please try again.");
    n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
}
```

### TryParse

- The `TryParse` method allows us to parse strings, and to "extract" a number out of them if they contain one, or to be given a way to recover if they don't.
- `int.TryParse` takes two arguments, a string and a variable name (prefixed by the keyword `out`) and returns a boolean. 
    - If the first argument is convertable to the desired data type, the method returns _true_ and saves the string into the variable name as the desired datatype.     - If the first argument is _not_ convertable to the desired datatype, it returns _false_ and 0 is saved into the variable name.
- The `TryParse` method is typically structured like so:

```
bool result = <numeric datatype>.TryParse(<string to convert>, out <numeric variable to store result>)
```

- The first argument in TryParse can be string variable, literal, or any method call that returns a string, e.g. `Console.ReadLine()`.
- The second argument is a variable of the same type as the `TryParse` operation

### Example 2

```
// literal to int type
int myInt;
bool result = int.TryParse("5", out myInt);

// string variable to double type 
// the output variable can be declared simultaneously
string numStr = "3.25";
bool success = double.TryParse(numStr, out double myDoubleVar);

// calling TryParse with result of ReadLine() method call
// without intermediate variables
bool isNumeric = float.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out float myFloatVar);
```

### Example 3

```
Console.WriteLine("Please enter a positive number");
int n;
while ( ! int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine() , out n))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The input is not correct. Please enter a positive number.");
}
```

## Vocabulary

Variables and values can have multiple roles, but it is useful to mention three different roles in the context of loops:

Counter

: Variable that is incremented every time a given event occurs.

```
int i = 0; // i is a counter
while (i < 10){
    Console.WriteLine($"{i}");
    i++;
}
```

Sentinel Value

:  A special value that signals that the loop needs to end.

```
Console.WriteLine("Give me a string.");
string ans = Console.ReadLine();
while (ans != "Quit") // The sentinel value is "Quit".
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hi!");
    Console.WriteLine("Enter \"Quit\" to quit, or anything else to continue.");
    ans = Console.ReadLine();
}
```

Accumulator

: Variable used to keep the total of several values.

```
int i = 0, total = 0;
while (i < 10){
    total += i; // total is the accumulator.
    i++;
}

Console.WriteLine($"The sum from 0 to {i} is {total}.");
```


We can have an accumulator and a sentinel value at the same time:

```
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number to sum, or \"Done\" to stop and print the total.");
string enter = Console.ReadLine();
int sum = 0;
while (enter != "Done")
{
    sum += int.Parse(enter);
    Console.WriteLine("Enter a number to sum, or \"Done\" to stop and print the total.");
    enter = Console.ReadLine();
}
Console.WriteLine($"Your total is {sum}.");
```

You can have counter, accumulator and sentinel values at the same time!

```
int a = 0;
int sum = 0;
int counter = 0;
Console.WriteLine("Enter an integer, or N to quit.");
string entered = Console.ReadLine();
while (entered != "N") // Sentinel value
{
    a = int.Parse(entered);
    sum += a; // Accumulator
    Console.WriteLine("Enter an integer, or N to quit.");
    entered = Console.ReadLine();
    counter++; // counter
}
Console.WriteLine($"The average is {sum / (double)counter}");
```

We can distinguish between three "flavors" of loops (that are not mutually exclusive):

Sentinel controlled loop

: The exit condition tests if a variable has (or is different from) a _specific value_.

User controlled loop

: The number of iterations depends on the _user_.

Count controlled loop

: The number of iterations depends on a _counter_.

Note that a user-controlled loop can be sentinel-controlled (that is the example we just saw), but also count-controlled ("Give me a value, and I will iterate a task that many times").

 
# While Loop With Complex Conditions
In the following example, a complex boolean expression is used in the _while_ statement. The program gets a value and tries to parse it as an integer. If the value can not be convertible to an integer, the program tries again, but not more than three times.

```
int c;
string message;
int count;
bool res;

Console.WriteLine("Please, enter an integer.");
message = Console.ReadLine();
res = int.TryParse(message, out c);
count = 0; // The user has 3 tries: count will be 0, 1, 2, and then we default.
while (!res && count < 3)
{
    count++;
    if (count == 3)
    {
        c = 1;
        Console.WriteLine("I'm using the default value 1.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The value entered was not an integer.");
        Console.WriteLine("Please, enter an integer.");
        message = Console.ReadLine();
        res = int.TryParse(message, out c);
    }
}
Console.WriteLine("The value is: " + c);
```
